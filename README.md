# Don't Starve App

This project is for beginning players who need a to-do list to play, and for learn reactjs.

For this proposal, Don't Starve App is an item searcher and shows relationships in a graph.

After searching for the necessary items, you can add to your task list and import or export to share with your friends, as they both collect the same items in the game.

E After adding the items, you can view the entire base of items needed to create that item, you can view the junction of all the necessary items, or, if you click on the item, you can view more specific information for that item or delete the item from your list.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`
